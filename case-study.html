                    <h2>Case Study 1: Scalable Project Data System for Food Processing Equipment</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>I led the build of a scalable project management and data workflow system for a food-processing equipment manufacturer (systems valued at $3M+). The existing process relied on siloed information and ad-hoc reporting, which made it hard to optimize workflows or generate reliable metrics.</p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>Project Manager. I owned the business case, vendor selection, solution design, rollout, and ongoing maintenance.</p>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project data was fragmented across teams, creating a "black box" for process performance.</li>
                        <li>Reporting was unclear and inconsistent, limiting decision-making.</li>
                        <li>Existing tooling was not scalable for growing program complexity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Secured leadership buy-in with a 6-page business case outlining the ROI of upgrading data management.</li>
                        <li>Interviewed stakeholders across business units to map required reports, outputs, and workflows.</li>
                        <li>Evaluated Notion, Coda, Monday.com, ClickUp, and Asana; selected Coda for flexibility, time-to-value, and pricing.</li>
                        <li>Built custom workflows in Coda for multiple user types, with role-based data sharing.</li>
                        <li>Implemented cloud access for mobile use (no VPN required), while maintaining security constraints.</li>
                        <li>Wrote scripts and automations to connect ERP data into the Coda system.</li>
                        <li>Trained users and documented the new workflows.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>100% adoption within the PM team.</li>
                        <li>600 users onboarded across 10 teams.</li>
                        <li>Reporting time reduced by 1-2 days; reports now generated in minutes with no manual spreadsheet entry.</li>
                        <li>Built 4 automated data pipelines to downstream departments.</li>
                        <li>Centralized, secure cloud access eliminated the need for VPN while keeping data shared only as required.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Case Study 2: Timesheet Automation for HR Imports</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>I built an automation workflow to pull timesheet data via the Clockify API, reformat it into a clean .csv, and prepare it for HR import. This removed repetitive manual entry and improved weekly payroll processing.</p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>Developer. I owned API integration, transformation logic, and the lightweight front-end used by the team.</p>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HR relied on manual time entry into ADP from weekly timesheet exports.</li>
                        <li>The process was slow, error-prone, and repeated every week.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used the Clockify API to extract timesheet data for 20 employees each week.</li>
                        <li>Wrote a Python script to transform and standardize the export into HR-ready .csv format.</li>
                        <li>Built a simple local front-end to trigger and verify the export.</li>
                        <li>Hosted the solution locally to keep data on-prem and minimize setup overhead.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Saved 8 hours of manual entry time every week.</li>
                        <li>Improved consistency and reduced input errors by eliminating manual copy/paste.</li>
                        <li>Made HR imports predictable and repeatable.</li>
                    </ul>
